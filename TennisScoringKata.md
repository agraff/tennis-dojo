# Tennis Scoring Kata #

**Your task is to implement a tennis scoring program.**

Summary of tennis scoring:

### Game ###

- A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent.

- The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as "love", "fifteen", "thirty", and "forty" respectively.

- If at least three points have been scored by each player, and the scores are equal, the score is "deuce".

- If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is "advantage" for the player in the lead.


### Set ###

- A set is won by the first player to have won at least six games and at least two games more than the opponent. (For this exercise, ignore tie-break rules.)


### Match ###

- A match is won by the first player to have won two sets.
